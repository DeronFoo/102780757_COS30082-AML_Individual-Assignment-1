ðŸ¦… EfficientNetV2 Transfer Learning for Fine-Grained Image Classification

This repository contains the complete implementation, analysis, and report for a transfer learning project using EfficientNetV2-L applied to fine-grained image classification (e.g., Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset). The project integrates modern deep learning techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimisation (SAM), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Hybrid Loss (Label Smoothing + ArcFace), and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) to enhance stability and generalisation in low-data settings.
